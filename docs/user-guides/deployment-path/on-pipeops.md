In this section, we'll guide you through setting up your PipeOps account using one of PipeOps' own servers. Follow these steps to configure your server and seamlessly deploy your applications.

### Step 1: Select Your Server Hosting Platform

1. Log in to your dashboard.
2. You'll be prompted to choose where you want to create your server.
3. Select "**On PipeOps**" as your server creation method.

### Step 2: Decide On The Physical Location Of Your Server

You'll then be directed to:
1. Choose a server name.
2. Select your server location. We've implemented a geo-location pricing model to ensure you're billed in your local currency, shielding you from exchange rate fluctuations.

### Step 3: Customize Your Server

After selecting the location for your server, it's time to tailor it to your specific needs. Customize your server based on these three key metrics:

1. **VCPU (Virtual Central Processing Unit)**:
   - Choose the number of virtual CPUs to allocate to your server. This determines the processing power available for running your applications and handling tasks.

2. **Memory**:
   - Select the amount of memory (RAM) to allocate to your server. Memory is crucial for storing and accessing data while your applications are running. Choose a suitable amount based on the requirements of your applications and workload.

3. **Storage**:
   - Determine the storage capacity for your server, which includes both the operating system and data storage. Consider the size of your applications and the amount of data they generate to ensure you have adequate storage space. You can also choose between different storage types, such as solid-state drives (SSD) or hard disk drives (HDD), depending on performance and cost considerations.

By customizing these aspects of your server, you can optimize its performance and resource allocation to meet the specific demands of your applications and workload.

Once you've decided on your desired server specification, PipeOps will automatically check if your credit balance covers the cost. 

if you don't have enough credits for your desired server specification, you'll be directed to a payment portal where you can make the necessary payment to access seamless deployments with PipeOps.

However, if your credits are sufficient, the transaction will be deducted from your credit balance without any additional charges. 

### Step 4: Proceed

After successfully making payment for your server, you'll receive a confirmation stating "Congratulations! Your subscription is active." Click on the **Done** button to proceed to the next steps in the setup process.
