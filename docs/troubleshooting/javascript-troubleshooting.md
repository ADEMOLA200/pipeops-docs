# General JavaScript Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

Deploying JavaScript applications can sometimes present unexpected challenges. This guide provides troubleshooting tips to help you resolve common issues encountered during the deployment process.

## Problem: Files Not Rendering Properly Due to Mimetype Bug
**Issue:**
Some files are not rendered properly due to keyword restrictions leading to a mimetype bug from the server. Additionally, JavaScript scripts in the public directory are not running correctly.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue:
1. **Rename Files and Directories:** Rename the files and directories to keywords that are not restricted on the server.
2. **Move Inline Scripts:** Move all code in your JavaScript script files into the `index.html` file directly, using them as inline scripts. This ensures that the scripts are properly executed without being blocked by the server.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        // Your JavaScript code here
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Problem: Images Not Visible After Deployment
**Issue:**
After deploying your JavaScript project, the images are not visible when you click on the live link.

**Solution:**
This issue can be resolved by installing the `sharp` package in your project. `sharp` is a high-performance image processing library that Next.js uses for optimized image handling. You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install sharp
```

After installing `sharp`, redeploy your project to see the images correctly.

## Problem: Project Not Autodeploying on New Commit
**Issue:**
Your project is not autodeploying when you make a new commit to your GitHub repository.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, ensure that the PipeOps app is installed on your GitHub profile to allow updates to reach the PipeOps webhooks:
1. Go to the screen to add your organization and install the PipeOps app on your profile.
2. Alternatively, you can go directly [here](https://github.com/apps/pipeops/installations/select_target) to install the PipeOps app.

## Additional Tips

### Check Your Environment Configuration
Ensure that all your environment variables are correctly set up. Missing or incorrect environment variables can cause deployment issues.

### Review Deployment Logs
Logs provide detailed information about what went wrong during the deployment process. Access the deployment logs from your PipeOps dashboard and look for error messages or warnings.

### Validate Configuration Files
Incorrect settings in configuration files like `next.config.js` or other build configuration files can cause deployment issues. Validate the syntax and settings in your configuration files.

### Ensure Sufficient Resources
Check the resource usage on your target server. If resources are insufficient, consider upgrading your server plan or optimizing your application to use fewer resources.

### Update Dependencies
Outdated dependencies can cause compatibility issues. Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date using package managers like npm or yarn.

### Network Connectivity
Ensure that your server has a stable internet connection. Verify that all necessary ports are open.

### Build Scripts
Review your build scripts defined in your `package.json`. Ensure they are correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Conclusion
Deploying a JavaScript application can be a smooth process with the right troubleshooting steps. By following these tips and solutions, you'll be better equipped to handle common deployment issues and ensure a successful deployment for your projects. Happy coding!
