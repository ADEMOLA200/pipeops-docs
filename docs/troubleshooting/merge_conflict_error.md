Merge Conflict Files

Error Overview
When working with version control systems like Git, you may encounter a merge conflict. This happens when changes in different branches conflict with each other, and Git cannot automatically resolve the differences. The error you're seeing is due to unresolved conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) in your `settings.py` file, which result in a syntax error.

Error Message
File "C:\projectpath", line 'error line'
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    ^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Cause of the Error
This error occurs because the file contains conflict markers that Git inserts when it encounters a merge conflict. These markers indicate the sections of code that are in conflict. The interpreter does not understand these markers, leading to a `SyntaxError`.

Conflict Markers
- `<<<<<<< HEAD` indicates the start of the conflicting changes from your current branch.
- `=======` separates your changes from the incoming changes.
- `>>>>>>> branch-name` marks the end of the incoming changes from the other branch.

Steps to Fix the Error

1. Open the File with Conflict Markers
   - Open the file in a text editor or IDE.

2. Locate the Conflict Markers
   - Look for lines containing `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch-name`.

3. Resolve the Conflict
   - Decide which changes to keep. You can choose one side, merge both manually, or make new changes.

4. Remove the Conflict Markers
   - Delete the lines with `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch-name`.

Example of Resolving a Conflict

Before:
```python
# Some settings
DEBUG = True
<<<<<<< HEAD
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost']
=======
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com']
>>>>>>> branch-name
# More settings
```

After resolving the conflict:
```python
# Some settings
DEBUG = True
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', 'example.com']  # or choose one
# More settings
```

when this issue has been resolved, commit and redeploy
