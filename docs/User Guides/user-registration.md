## Step 2: Visit the Registration Page

To begin the registration process, click on the 'Deploy app' or 'Deploy a free app' button on the top right corner, or the middle of your screen. This would redirect you to the pipeops signin console. Click on the 'Create a new account here' link, and begin your registration.

## Step 3: Sign In Options

In the 'Create an account' sign up box, you have 4 options to sign up.

- Sign up using your existing GitHub account.
- Sign up using your existing GitLab account.
- Sign up using your existing BitBucket account.
- Sign up using your an email account.

In the first 3 options, you will need to enter your credentials to allow pipeops connect with your account. You also will not need to connect to that repository provider later if you already chose it as your sign up method.
